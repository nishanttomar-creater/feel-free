# DESCRIPTION
This is a women-centric healthcare website that tries to break all the taboos which are persisted till now. Through this site, we aim to empower women to prioritise their health as it is indispensable. There are so many health-related problems that a woman can phase if she didnâ€™t take care of her health. We help them feel motivated during their period cycle by showing some pop-up messages and providing details related to all the common health-related problems. We even help them in connecting to the concerned doctors whenever needed.
